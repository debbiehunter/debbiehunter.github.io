<h2>Preparing yourself</h2>
You want to face surgery with the strongest and healthiest body possible. To ensure this attention should be made to: 
<ul>
<li>Nutrition - Eat healthy foods and drink adequate water in the days leading up to surgery. Protein will help your bones and muscles recover from surgery. Avoiding caffeine during this time will also help with fluid balance after surgery. (Leach, Spaulding, Thomas, Conn,and Kutash, 2013)  </li>
<li>Medications - Make a careful list of all medications you take, including prescription drugs as well as over-the-counter items. Your doctor may recommend tapering off and stopping certain medications before your surgery date, as they can impact bleeding during the operation</li>
<li>Stop Smoking - Smoking impacts your blood vessels and lungs, and can slow your recovery from surgery.</li>
<li>Exercise – Consult your doctor as to which exercise if any should be done before surgery.</li>
<li>Rest – get adequate rest leading up to the surgery you will want to go into the surgery well rested. </li>
<li>Attitude - It’s a good idea to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally for these realities, gathering your inner strength and focusing on the ultimate outcome of better mobility.</li>
<li>Blood Donations -Talk to your doctor about the option of donating your own blood ahead of surgery to be used if you need a transfusion. (Bonfante, 2016) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparing Home</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove all throw rugs, cords and other obstructions to allow a wide path through the rooms of your home.</li>
<li>Place objects you will need frequently – clothing, cooking utensils, in locations so you can reach them without bending down or reaching up.</li>
<li>Assistive devices – after joint surgery you will need certain devices to aid in toileting, bathing, dressing, and picking items up. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparing Loved Ones</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you first leave the hospital you will need assistance in performing household activities. Arrange for family members or friends to be present.</li>
<li>In the cases that you may live alone, you may want to consider going to a specialized rehabilitation facility.  </li>
</ul>
