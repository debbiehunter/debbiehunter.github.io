Joints can be damaged by arthritis and other diseases.
*	Arthritis or simply years of use may cause the joint to wear away.
*	Diseases and damage inside a joint can also limit blood flow, causing problems.
*	Excess weight can also put added pressure on joints allowing for greater wear and tear. 
*	Old sports injuries can impact the integrity of joints.
